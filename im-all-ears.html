                The 'I'm All Ears' mobile app listens to ambient sound and performs sound recognition with Teachable Machine, which then can send signals to the wristband using MQTT protocol. The reason why we chose the phone as the sensor input is that the phone has more computation power than micro-controllers and the resources were limited. The app also has implemented the feature of "Hearing The Moments", which allows people with hearing loss to keep track of the important sounds as timeline events in their everyday lives.

            </h2>
            <p>
                We were tasked with creating a physical prototype to solve an everyday problem. The problem
                we chose was addressing the daily challenges faced by those who have loss of hearing, for which we 
                developed a device that translates sound into feedback as vibration and digitally displayed text. Our solution aims to
                take advantage of a person's stronger senses as an alternative to their weaker hearing.

                The Solution
            </h2>
            <p>
                We developed a wristband that uses machine learning to translate everyday sounds into vibrations
                that can be felt on the wrist paired with a digital screen that displays the name and/or source of the sound as text.
                This device serves mainly as an alert system that helps people with hearing loss become aware of sounds that are important to them, their safety, and their wellbeing.

                Product Explanation
            </h2>
            <p>
                Our prototype is a device that wraps around the user's wrist using a tightenable strap to assist their understanding of surrounding sounds using vibrating motors and an LCD screen for sensual and visual feedback.
                <br>
                <br>
                Using machine learning, our device is able to translate detected sounds into on-screen text and vibrational response for feedback. We chose these two methods of feedback because while the display 
                can provide information about sounds surrounding the user, it may be difficult to view in certain circumstances such as in bright conditions, whereas the using only vibration may not always stand out when the
                user is actively performing other activities. Furthermore, vibration only captures the user's attention indicating that a sound was detected, but does not explain the sound. This is our team felt that this 
                combination of output methods works excellently for our prototype.

                Product Technical Overview
            </h2>
            <p>
                In order to make our device as small as possible, we decided to use a small microcontroller, specifically the WEMOS D1 mini board. Its Wi-Fi features proved to be useful to what we were aiming for.
                <br>
                <br>
                We also utilized 3 vibration motors and an LCD screen.
                We designed and implemented an enclosure for our prototype that would allow us to wear the device on our wrists (using an elastic fabric as the wrist band) and fitted the band with the 3 vibrations motors.
                <br>
                <br>
                We also implemented an app utilizing a training model with Google's Teachable Machine, to recognize various everyday important sounds. We then connected the app to the MQTT server where we were able to send messages to the device in order to display content on the screen and vibrate one of the three motors

                        8. Another idea that was inspired by "I'm all Ears" was to record when a sound that is of significance to the user, such as laughter or cheering, occurs.
                        We would display the timeline of significant sound to the user through the use of an app, allowing important memories to be saved for the user to revisit.

                        9. This is similar to the "I am all Ears" idea, but instead of a wearable, it is a home pod device. The device listens for important sounds around the house, such as a tap left running or the suspicion of an intruder.
                        The device would send notifications to the user's phone and alert them when the sounds are detected.

                        10. With this variation, deaf people are able to enjoy music by feeling the music's rhythm as vibration. This idea is a hand-band that will provide the user with vibrational feedback on the music that is playing around them.
                        Deaf people could use this to practice their singing too, as the device would pick up the notes being sung and provide accurate feedback via vibrations of varying intensities.
