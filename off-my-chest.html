                The 'I'm All Ears' mobile app listens to ambient sound and performs sound recognition with Teachable Machine, which then can send signals to the wristband using MQTT protocol. The reason why we chose the phone as the sensor input is that the phone has more computation power than micro-controllers and the resources were limited. The app also has implemented the feature of "Hearing The Moments", which allows people with hearing loss to keep track of the important sounds as timeline events in their everyday lives.

            </h2>
            <p>
                We were tasked with creating an interface that augments in-person or remote communication or collaboration. 
                The problem we chose to address as part of this domain was helping address the thoughts, worries, or dilemmas that
                people are afraid to share with others due to fears such as fear of judgement, yet which they require to do so in order to take 
                a first step towards resolution by recieving advice and support from others in a way that is anonymous, secure,
                and moderated.

            <h2>
                The Solution
            </h2>
            <p>
                To solve this problem, we created a system for anonymously and safely sharing your fears, worries, or bothers
                to get them off of your chest, as the name of our system implies, and recieving support and advice for resolving them
                because speaking about your problems and getting help is an important step towards resolution.
                <br><br> 
                The platform for the input device was developed for a device that would ideally be
                accessible by the public for them to share their thoughts on the platform as they go about their day. It allows them to
                record a message with an automatically generated transcription, analyze the emotions and keywords that describe what
                they are feeling based on their recording, and post their recording to a public database where they can recieve feedback
                and support from the 'Off Your Chest' community in a seamless and easy-to-do way.
                <br><br> 
                The social platform is for accessing the database of audio recordings posted by the public to listen to the problems people 
                are experiencing to see what people in a similar position as you are experiencing, how they are overcoming their struggle, 
                and for providing support or feedback to them via an audio or text-based comment. Thus, our system takes a collaborative approach
                through anonymous interpersonal communication to help address mental health.

                Product Technical Overview
            </h2>
            <p>
                In order to make our device as small as possible, we decided to use a small microcontroller, specifically the WEMOS D1 mini board. Its Wi-Fi features proved to be useful to what we were aiming for.
                <br>
                <br>
                We also utilized 3 vibration motors and an LCD screen.
                We designed and implemented an enclosure for our prototype that would allow us to wear the device on our wrists (using an elastic fabric as the wrist band) and fitted the band with the 3 vibrations motors.
                <br>
                <br>
                We also implemented an app utilizing a training model with Google's Teachable Machine, to recognize various everyday important sounds. We then connected the app to the MQTT server where we were able to send messages to the device in order to display content on the screen and vibrate one of the three motors

                        you, and by helping you become a stronger candidate overall.

                        device would act like a friendship charm to indicate to another person that you are thinking of them by tapping 
                        your device from the pair, which would illuminate their device and remind them of you.

                        would allow you to communicate your interpretation or understanding of the culture with others to help build upon it.

                        This recording would be uploaded to an online database where people can browse through these recorded posts to potentially help overcome their own struggles and to provide meaningful feedback to others

                        1. This variation of "Off Your Chest" would alert and give the option to contact a mental health helpline if the audio recording made by a person
                        contained concerning material suggesting that someone was at their breaking point or, for example, was considering self harm. Additional resources

                       2. This variation of "Off Your Chest" displays the idea of having a rating system for users of the web platform, who can make accounts to comment / reply on people's anonymous recordings. The
                       user's rating would be based on the average of the like to dislike ratio across all comments they have made and it would be a useful resource for determining someone's 
                       helpfulness or credibility on the platform.

                        3. With this variation of "Off Your Chest", users of the publicly accessible input device would be able to schedule when they would like to make their post. This would
                        give them some time to self-reflect on what they said, some of which they may not have expected to say, before receiving feedback from the "Off Your Chest" community via its

                        7. This variation considers the app the device uses, where the posts are organized by keywords/groups, represented by bubbles. Each bubble is an audio post of an anonymous user with an associated
                        keyword(s) indicating the tone/mood of the stories. Users can drag these bubbles to arrange/organize different posts, and upon clicking a bubble, the audio will be played.

                        8. This variation involves the app the device uses. Using Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and the transcript from the recording, we can perform natural language processing (i.e. keywords extraction, sentimental analysis).

                        9. This variation involves the actual recording from the user, where using speech to text will be utilized when the user is talking and recording. Upon clicking "Post" the device will upload both the audio file and the transcript from the recording.

                        10. This variation includes the communication device for the user to input their speech. In this case, an iPad is being used, supported on a tripod and a flat surface for the iPad to rest on. The basic idea of the application platform on the iPad is shown as well.
