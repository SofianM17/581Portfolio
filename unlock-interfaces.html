                The Problem
            </h2>
            <p>
                We were tasked with creating a touch-based and another sensor-based interface for unlocking a mobile phone
                in a way similar to 'slide to unlock'. Animation had to be used to provide feedback to the user, and both
                techniques needed to avoid accidental activation.
            </p>
        </div>

        
        <div class="our-solution">
            <h2>
                The Solution
            </h2>
            <p>
                We first developed a sensor-based implementation that utilizes the phone's gyroscopic sensor to illuminate the edge of the phone that the user tilts towards
                and unlocks the phone using pattern recognition. Initially to unlock the phone, a pre-made pattern is shown to the user and the user must replicate this pattern
                by tilting the phone to illuminate the edges in the same order as shown. Then, the user can set a custom illumination pattern in the phone's settings
                and choose to make this custom pattern visible (i.e. allow it to be played before entry for reference) or hide it completely for the next time that the phone is unlocked. Accidental activation is avoided by the complexity
                of replicating a unique pattern by tilting the phone in various directions.
                <br>
                <br>
                We then developed a gesture-based implementation that requires touching and holding a bubble and filling it according to a pattern of 'levels' within the bubble,
                essentially a series of circles of varying diameters within the main bubble. Authentication using
                custom patterns is also possible with this implementation.

            <p>
                We started by sketching ideas that would solve the problem, with consideration for both gesture / multitouch based and sensor based implementations.
                These are 10 of my own initial concept sketches, which I pitched to and shared with the project team as possible solutions.

                    <p class="sketch-p">
                        1. This sketch portrays the idea of clicking and holding a 'bubble' or circle on the screen. While the bubble is being held, it will be filled with a random colour,
                        and while not being held, the color will retract until the bubble returns to its original empty state. To unlock the phone, the user would hold the bubble until it has
                        completely been filled, at which point the phone would unlock.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="sketch-item">
                    <img src="Media/Proj2/RotateObject_Gesture.jpg" width="400">
                    <p class="sketch-p">
                        2. This implementation would simply require the user to rotate the randomly displayed object to an upright position by repeatedly tapping it until it is straight. Once the
                        object is positioned correctly, the user's phone would unlock.
                    </p>

                    <p class="sketch-p">
                        3. This idea also requires rotating an object until it is positioned straight to unlock the phone, though this implementation would require using the phone's gyroscope sensor to turn the object
                        rather than multitouch input from the user. Tilting the phone right or left would turn the object accordingly, and the object will 'snap' into place once it is held straight
                        by the user for a few seconds so micromovements detected  by the phone's gyroscopic sensor do not make unlocking a difficult process.

                        4. This sketch portrays the idea of drawing an answer to a simple, random math equation onto the screen to unlock the phone.

                </div>

                    <p class="sketch-p">
                        5. This implementation would require tilting the phone to a required angle to unlock it. The app would display the degrees the phone is currently tilted using the phone's 
                        gyroscopic sensor, and the displayed degree would be colored red, green, or a color in between (i.e. yellow) indicating how close / far the user is from the required angle.
                        Once the user tilts the phone to the correct angle and holds it at that angle for a few seconds, the phone will unlock.

                        6. This app would display a pattern of drum pads to play using a sequence of colors that lights up the displayed drum pads in a random order. Once the user has replicated this pattern,
                        the phone will unlock. Each pad will also produce a different sound such as a kick, snare, hi hat, etc.

                    <p class="sketch-p">
                        7. This sketch depicts the idea of turning the phone like a key - holding it in front of you horizontally and then turning it clockwise - to unlock the phone. This 
                        implementation would make use of the phone's gyroscopic sensors.

                    <p class="sketch-p">
                        8. Designed to encourage smiling, this implementation would make use of the phone's front camera and unlock the device if the user's smile was detected.

                    <p class="sketch-p">
                        9. The implementation that this sketch depicts would use the phone's microphone to listen for the name of the object shown to the user in the language
                        selected. The user could select from a few available languages to say the name of the object in, and this app would be extremely beneficial in helping
                        the user build their vocabulary in a language they wish to learn.

                        10. This app would require using the phone's gyroscopic sensor to bring turbulent waves under control
                        by turning the phone in the direction opposite to the wave until the boat is stabilized.

                We narrowed down our ideas to my own idea of filling a bubble to unlock the phone (multitouch implementation) and to
                Juan Pablo's edge illumination (sensor-based implementation) idea.

                    <p class="sketch-p">
                        1. This variation of the initial edge illumination idea focuses on adding aesthetic appeal to the original 
                        design idea by making the light bars slicker and appear more as a diffused glow rather than as colored blocks. This
                        idea was implemented into the final version of the interface.

                    <p class="sketch-p">
                       2. This variation introduces the idea of showing a unique pattern rather than replicating a previously shown pattern to unlock the phone. This
                       is to add an element of security / authentication to <i>unlock</i> the phone rather than a way to simply exit the lockscreen. This
                       variation helped us incorporate the idea of setting unique patterns and toggling if the pattern will initially be displayed or not
                       to add an element of security to the interface.

                        3. This detail introduces the idea having the ability to swipe down to display a new pattern. This variation
                        helped us implement the idea of replaying the current pattern using touch input. We opted to have user-defined
                        patterns rather than random patterns instead, though the idea of being able to 'play' the pattern remained the same
                        from this variation.

                    <p class="sketch-p">
                        4. This detail introduces the idea of prompting the user to inform them of if their attempted pattern was correct or incorrect.
                        In our final implementation, we added a 'shaking' screen animation to inform the user that their attempt was incorrect.

                    <p class="sketch-p">
                        5. This variation reworks the idea of simply lighting the edge of the screenby tilting to tilting a bubble into
                        an edge of the screen, with each edge having circles now instead of rectangular bars. This idea was influenced by our
                        touch-based bubble idea, though we did not end up using it.

                    <p class="sketch-p">
                        6. This variation of the bubble idea adds layers with varying diameters to the bubble. It also introduces the idea
                        of holding and releasing to resize the bubble to different layers in a pattern to unlock the phone.
                        This variation heavily influenced our final design of the touch-based implementation because it introduced the core 
                        functionality that our final design has.

                        7. This variation is similar to the original bubble idea - it requires touching and holding to expand a balloon
                        instead of a circle, and the balloon pops to reveal the main screen. This idea was not implemented.

                        9. This variation requires holding a rope until a climber is able to successfully climb to the top of a cliff. It essentially displays
                        a climbing animation. This variation of the multitouch bubble idea was abandoned.

                        10. Rather than filling a bubble by tapping and holding, this variation reveals the main screen from the lock screen when 
                        the screen is tapped and held. This variation of the bubble idea was abandoned.
